Describe workflows. Share them. Run them.

`zig` is an orchestration CLI for AI coding agents. It uses [zag](https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/zag) behind the scenes to let you describe a workflow in natural language, capture it as a shareable `.zwf` file, and replay it anywhere with a single command.

## Why zig?

- **Natural language workflows** — Describe what you want done in plain English; an AI agent creates the orchestration file for you
- **Shareable `.zwf` files** — Workflow definitions are portable files you can commit, share, and version alongside your code
- **Powered by zag** — Built on zag's battle-tested orchestration primitives (spawn, wait, collect, pipe) without needing to learn them directly
- **Reproducible automation** — Run the same workflow across projects, teams, and machines with `zig run`

## How it works

1. **Describe** — Tell `zig` what you want to automate. It launches a zag interactive session where an AI agent helps you design the workflow and produces a `.zwf` orchestration file.

2. **Share** — The `.zwf` file is a self-contained workflow definition. Commit it to your repo, send it to a colleague, or publish it.

3. **Run** — Execute the workflow with `zig run <workflow>`. Zig parses the `.zwf` file and delegates to zag's orchestration engine to carry out each step.

```bash
# Create a workflow interactively — an agent helps you design a .zwf file
zig workflow create code-review

# See what workflows are available
zig workflow list

# Run a workflow
zig run code-review

# Start the HTTP API
zig serve

# Start the HTTP API with the built-in React chat web UI
zig serve --web
```

### Web UI

`zig serve --web` embeds a single-page React chat interface inside the
`zig` binary (no filesystem or Node runtime required). When the server
starts it prints a `Web UI:` URL with an authentication token baked in —
open it in a browser to start a workflow creation chat. Submit the first
message to spawn an interactive zag session, then send follow-up messages
to collaborate with the agent until your `.zwf` file is ready.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.85+** (edition 2024) — for building from source
- **zag CLI** — zig delegates to zag for agent orchestration ([install zag](https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/zag#install))
- At least one AI agent CLI installed (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, or Ollama — see [zag docs](https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/zag#agent-clis))

```

### `zig run`

Execute a `.zwf` or `.zwfz` workflow. Zig resolves the workflow by name or file path, parses the orchestration steps, and delegates execution to zag.

```bash
zig run code-review
zig run ./workflows/deploy.zwf
zig run code-review "focus on the authentication module"
zig run code-review --no-resources   # skip injecting the <resources> block
zig run code-review --no-memory      # skip injecting the <memory> block
```

### `zig listen`

Tail a running or completed zig session. Streams step output in real time, useful for monitoring long-running workflows.

```bash
zig listen                     # tail the most recently started session
zig listen --latest            # same as above (explicit)
zig listen --active            # tail the most recently active (still-running) session
zig listen abc123              # tail a specific session by ID or prefix
```

### `zig workflow create`

Launch an interactive session where an AI agent guides you through designing a workflow and produces a `.zwf` file.

```bash
zig workflow create my-workflow
zig workflow create deploy --pattern sequential
zig workflow create --output workflows/ci.zwf
```

Supported `--pattern` values: `sequential`, `fan-out`, `generator-critic`,
`coordinator-dispatcher`, `hierarchical-decomposition`, `human-in-the-loop`,
`inter-agent-communication`.

### `zig workflow update`

Revise an existing workflow interactively with an AI agent. The agent loads
the current definition, walks through your requested changes, and writes the
updated file back in place.

```bash
zig workflow update my-workflow
zig workflow update ./workflows/deploy.zwf
```

### `zig workflow list`

List all `.zwf` / `.zwfz` workflows discoverable from the current directory
(`./`, `./workflows/`, and `.zig/workflows/` walking up to the git root).

```bash
zig workflow list
zig workflow list --json    # machine-readable output
```

### `zig workflow delete`

Delete a `.zwf` workflow file by name or path.

```bash
zig workflow delete my-workflow
zig workflow delete workflows/old-pipeline.zwf
```

### `zig workflow pack`

Pack a workflow directory into a `.zwfz` zip archive. The directory must contain a workflow TOML file and can include prompt files referenced via `system_prompt_file` or `default_file`. The resulting archive works with `zig run` and `zig validate`.

```bash
zig workflow pack ./my-workflow/
zig workflow pack ./my-workflow/ --output custom-name.zwfz
```

### `zig resources`

Manage reference files (CVs, style guides, reference docs, …) that zig advertises to step agents through their system prompt. Resources live in three on-disk tiers — `~/.zig/resources/_shared/`, `~/.zig/resources/<workflow-name>/`, and `<git-root>/.zig/resources/` — and are merged with any inline `resources = [...]` declared in the workflow file.

```bash
# Drop a CV in a workflow-specific global tier
zig resources add ./cv.md --workflow cover-letter

# Stage shared style guides for every workflow
zig resources add ./style-guide.md --global

# Project-local reference docs (walks up to the git root)
zig resources add ./architecture.md --cwd

# Inspect what the collector will see
zig resources list
zig resources where --workflow cover-letter

# Skip resource injection for a single run
zig run cover-letter --no-resources
```

Run `zig man resources` for the full collection model and tier ordering.

### `zig memory`

Manage a memory scratch pad — durable notes, summaries, and artifacts that
zig advertises to step agents through a `<memory>` block in the system prompt.
Entries are tracked by numeric ID with metadata (name, description, tags, and
optional workflow/step association) and live under `~/.zig/memory/` (global
and per-workflow tiers) plus `<git-root>/.zig/memory/` (project tier).

```bash
# Add a note for a specific workflow
zig memory add ./architecture-notes.md \
  --workflow cover-letter \
  --description "Team architecture overview" \
  --tags arch,design

# Update metadata on an existing entry
zig memory update 42 --description "Updated overview" --tags arch

# Inspect, search, or remove entries
zig memory list --workflow cover-letter
zig memory show 42
zig memory search "authentication" --scope section
zig memory delete 42

# Skip the <memory> block on a single run
zig run cover-letter --no-memory
```

Run `zig docs memory` for the full memory model and search semantics.

### `zig serve`

Start the zig HTTP API server (`zig-serve`) for orchestrating workflows
remotely. Supports TLS, bearer-token authentication, rate limiting, SSE
streaming, and graceful shutdown. Settings can also be stored in
`~/.zig/serve.toml` under a `[server]` section — precedence is
CLI flag > env var > config file > default.

```bash
zig serve                                       # bind 127.0.0.1:3000
zig serve --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0
zig serve --token "$ZIG_SERVE_TOKEN"            # or set ZIG_SERVE_TOKEN env var
zig serve --tls                                 # auto-generated self-signed cert
zig serve --tls-cert cert.pem --tls-key key.pem # explicit cert/key
zig serve --rate-limit 100                      # 100 req/s
zig serve --web                                 # also serve the embedded React UI
```

Run `zig man serve` for the complete flag reference and API routes.

### `zig validate`

Validate a `.zwf` or `.zwfz` workflow file for structural correctness without executing it.

```bash
zig validate my-workflow.zwf
zig validate my-workflow.zwfz
```

### `zig man`

Show built-in manual pages for zig commands (zig, run, listen, serve, workflow, validate, resources).

```bash
zig man run
zig man workflow
```

### `zig docs`

Show conceptual documentation (zwf, patterns, variables, conditions, memory).

```bash
zig docs zwf
zig docs patterns
```

## The `.zwf` / `.zwfz` format

A `.zwf` file is a TOML workflow definition that describes a DAG of AI agent steps with shared variables, conditional routing, and data flow. It is generated by `zig workflow create` and executed by `zig run`. The format captures:

- **Workflow metadata** — Name, description, tags, version, and default provider/model for all steps
- **Roles** — Reusable role definitions with system prompts (inline or loaded from files) that steps can reference
- **Steps** — The ordered (or parallel) operations to perform, each mapping to a zag agent invocation
- **Agent configuration** — Provider (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `ollama`) and model per step, with workflow-level defaults
- **Dependencies** — How steps relate to and depend on each other via `depends_on`
- **Variables & data flow** — Shared state between steps via `${var}` references, `saves` selectors, input bindings (`from = "prompt"`), and variable constraints (required, min/max, patterns, allowed values)
- **Resources** — Reference files advertised to step agents through the system prompt (paths only — agents read them on demand). Inline `resources = [...]` is merged with global (`~/.zig/resources/`) and project (`<git-root>/.zig/resources/`) tiers at run time
- **Memory** — A managed scratch pad of prior notes, summaries, and artifacts exposed to steps via a `<memory>` block in the system prompt. Entries live under `~/.zig/memory/` (global / per-workflow) and `<git-root>/.zig/memory/` (project), and can be injected, searched, or skipped per run with `--no-memory`
- **Conditions** — Expressions that control whether steps run (`var < 8`, `status == "done"`)
- **Step commands** — Steps can invoke different zag commands: `run` (default), `review`, `plan`, `pipe`, `collect`, `summary`
- **Isolation** — Steps can run in isolated git worktrees or Docker sandboxes
- **Advanced orchestration** — Race groups (first-to-finish cancels siblings), retry with model escalation, interactive sessions, file injection

Workflows can also be packaged as zip archives (via `zig workflow pack`) that bundle the TOML definition with external prompt files.

Run `zig docs zwf` for the full format specification, or see `zig docs patterns` for common orchestration patterns.

## Architecture

```
zig-core (library crate)
  .zwf/.zwfz file parsing, workflow validation, execution engine,
  session tracking, pack/archive support

zig-cli (binary crate)
  CLI argument parsing (clap) → dispatch to zig-core
  Delegates to zag for agent interactions
```

`zig` is built as a Rust workspace with two crates:

- **zig-core** — Core library that handles `.zwf`/`.zwfz` file parsing, workflow validation, execution engine, session tracking, and archive packing. Key modules:
  - `workflow/` — Model, parser, and validator for the `.zwf`/`.zwfz` format
  - `run` — Workflow execution (DAG resolution, step parallelization, streaming output)
  - `listen` — Real-time session tailing
  - `session` — Session lifecycle and log coordination
  - `pack` — Zip archive creation for workflow directories
  - `create` — Interactive workflow creation via zag
  - `update` — Interactive workflow revision via zag
  - `manage` — Workflow listing, display, and deletion (with `.zig/workflows/` discovery)
  - `resources` / `resources_manage` — Reference-file discovery and tier management
  - `memory` — Memory scratch pad (metadata store, search, and `<memory>` injection)
  - `prompt` — Versioned prompt templates for workflow generation
  - `config` — Shared configuration (e.g. `~/.zig/serve.toml`)
  - `man` — Built-in manpage system
  - `docs` — Built-in conceptual documentation
- **zig-cli** — Thin CLI wrapper that handles argument parsing (via clap) and dispatches commands to `zig-core`.
- **zig-serve** — Companion HTTP API server crate (invoked via `zig serve`) with optional embedded React web UI.

Under the hood, `zig-core` delegates to zag's orchestration primitives (`spawn`, `wait`, `collect`, `pipe`, etc.) to execute workflows.
